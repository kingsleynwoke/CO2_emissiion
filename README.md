**Course:** Data Analytics <br>
**Project title:** Data Analysis of emissions from CO<sub>2</sub> and other greenhouse gas 

### **My Task:**
- Analysis of CO<sub>2</sub> sources for four major emitters e.g China, India, Russia and United States
- The CO<sub>2</sub> data used are the annual total (territorial emissions) production-based emissions in million tonnes, excluding land-use change and traded goods.
- Source of data: [Our World in Data](https://github.com/owid/co2-data)

### **Sample results**
##### Total production-based CO<sub>2</sub> emission
